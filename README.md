# IDAN-LUSKI
Hello there,

I'm Idan Luski, a second-year student of Communication Systems Engineering in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computers.

What makes this journey truly exceptional is its holistic approach to both hardware and software, with a keen focus on the dynamic realm of communication. In terms of software proficiency, I'm well-versed in C, C++, and Python, allowing me to tackle diverse programming challenges. On the hardware frontier, I've honed my skills in utilizing oscilloscopes, adeptly crafting solutions through assembly language, and harnessing the power of MATLAB.

This program intricately weaves these skills together, resulting in a rich tapestry of knowledge. On the software front, we delve into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data structures, and the art of algorithmic problem-solving. Simultaneously, the hardware curriculum encompasses an expansive exploration of computer architecture, electrical principles, signal processing, wireless communication, and numerical systems, among other captivating subjects.

The synthesis of these two facets culminates in the realm of communication studies. This phase of the program grants profound insights into communication traffic dynamics, involvement in advanced lab work, and a deep dive into subjects such as game theory and machine learning, all tailored to communication contexts.

If you're curious to witness the culmination of these experiences, I invite you to explore my GitHub repository. Your interest and engagement would be most appreciated!
